## Overview

Cognis RAG-2-SQL is an AI-powered platform that enables users to connect databases, automatically generate rich metadata using LLMs, and query data using natural language. The system leverages massive parallel processing, serverless orchestration (AWS Step Functions), and intelligent UI updates for a seamless experience.

## Key Features

- **Admin onboarding and DB connection management**
- **Automated metadata extraction and AI-generated descriptions**
- **Natural language to SQL query agent**
- **Parallel and serverless architecture (AWS Step Functions, Lambda)**
- **Fast metadata search (OpenSearch)**
- **Scalable, production-grade design**

## Architecture

### Admin & Metadata Generation Flow

*Above: User submits a natural language query, which is refined, planned, and executed by the AI agent, returning intelligent results.*

## My Role
- Architected and implemented the pipeline and agent flows
- Integrated LLMs for metadata and query generation
- Designed for scalability, reliability, and user experience

## Outcome
- Delivered a production-ready platform for AI-powered database metadata and natural language querying, enabling both technical and non-technical users to extract value from complex data sources.
