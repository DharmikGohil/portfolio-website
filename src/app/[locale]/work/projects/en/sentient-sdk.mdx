## Overview

Sentient-SDK is an open-source RAG evaluation framework designed to automate quality assurance for LLM applications. It addresses the critical need for reliable testing in AI-driven systems by providing tools for shadow testing, modular scoring, and safety guardrails.

## Key Features

- **Shadow Testing Engine**: Designed using TypeScript and Async Iterators to sample live production traffic at a configurable rate without impacting user latency.
- **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Implemented patterns to decouple evaluation logic from providers (OpenAI, Claude), enabling modular scoring of faithfulness and hallucination.
- **Deterministic Guardrails**: Built a system using Regex and NLP heuristics to catch PII leaks and forbidden terms.
- **Automated QA**: Automates the quality assurance process for LLM applications, ensuring reliability and performance.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: TypeScript, Node.js
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API
- **Testing**: Jest (TDD)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, NPM Publishing

## Outcome

Successfully architected and published the `sentient-sdk` npm package, enabling developers to integrate robust evaluation pipelines into their LLM applications. The framework supports modular scoring and shadow testing, making it a versatile tool for maintaining high-quality AI systems.
